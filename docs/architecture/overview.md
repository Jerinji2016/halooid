# Halooid Platform Architecture Overview

## Introduction

The Halooid platform is a multi-product platform consisting of several integrated applications:

- **Taskodex**: Task and project management
- **Qultrix**: HR and employee management
- **AdminHub**: Administration and system management
- **CustomerConnect**: CRM and customer engagement
- **Invantray**: Inventory and asset management

This document provides an overview of the platform's architecture, components, and design decisions.

## Architecture Principles

The Halooid platform follows these key architectural principles:

1. **Microservices Architecture**: Each product and major functionality is implemented as a separate microservice.
2. **API-First Design**: All services expose well-defined APIs that other services can consume.
3. **Single Responsibility**: Each service has a clear, focused responsibility.
4. **Loose Coupling**: Services are designed to be independent and communicate through well-defined interfaces.
5. **High Cohesion**: Related functionality is grouped together within services.
6. **Scalability**: Services can be scaled independently based on demand.
7. **Resilience**: The system is designed to handle failures gracefully.
8. **Security by Design**: Security is built into the architecture from the ground up.

## Technology Stack

### Backend

- **Programming Language**: Go (Golang)
- **API Style**: REST and gRPC
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (primary data store)
- **Caching**: Redis
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication service
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC)
- **API Gateway**: Custom implementation using Go

### Frontend

- **Web**: Svelte with TypeScript
- **Mobile**: Flutter
- **Component Libraries**: 
  - Custom UI component library for web
  - Custom widget library for mobile

### DevOps

- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus and Grafana
- **Logging**: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)

## System Components

### Core Services

1. **Authentication Service**
   - Handles user registration, login, and token management
   - Provides JWT tokens for authenticated requests
   - Manages password reset and email verification

2. **RBAC Service**
   - Manages roles and permissions
   - Provides authorization checks for protected resources
   - Handles role assignments to users

3. **API Gateway**
   - Routes requests to appropriate services
   - Handles authentication and rate limiting
   - Provides a unified API interface for clients

### Product Services

Each product in the platform has its own set of microservices:

1. **Taskodex Services**
   - Task Management Service
   - Project Management Service
   - Time Tracking Service

2. **Qultrix Services**
   - Employee Record Management Service
   - Time-Off Management Service
   - Performance Management Service
   - Recruitment Service

3. **AdminHub Services**
   - System Monitoring Service
   - User Administration Service
   - Organization Management Service
   - Security Management Service

4. **CustomerConnect Services**
   - Contact Management Service
   - Lead Management Service
   - Opportunity Management Service
   - Customer Service Case Management Service

5. **Invantray Services**
   - Inventory Management Service
   - Warehouse Management Service
   - Asset Management Service
   - Procurement Management Service

## Data Flow

1. **Client Request Flow**
   - Client sends a request to the API Gateway
   - API Gateway authenticates the request using the Authentication Service
   - API Gateway routes the request to the appropriate service
   - Service processes the request and returns a response
   - API Gateway returns the response to the client

2. **Inter-Service Communication**
   - Services communicate with each other through REST or gRPC APIs
   - Authentication between services is handled using service accounts
   - Service discovery is managed through Kubernetes

## Security Architecture

1. **Authentication**
   - JWT-based authentication
   - Token refresh mechanism
   - Password hashing using bcrypt
   - Rate limiting for authentication endpoints

2. **Authorization**
   - Role-based access control (RBAC)
   - Permission checks at the service level
   - API Gateway level authorization

3. **Data Protection**
   - Encryption of sensitive data at rest
   - TLS for all communications
   - Input validation and sanitization

## Deployment Architecture

1. **Development Environment**
   - Local Docker Compose setup
   - Mock services for external dependencies

2. **Testing Environment**
   - Kubernetes cluster with test data
   - Automated testing through CI/CD pipeline

3. **Production Environment**
   - Kubernetes cluster with high availability
   - Auto-scaling based on demand
   - Regular backups and disaster recovery

## Monitoring and Observability

1. **Metrics Collection**
   - Service-level metrics
   - Infrastructure metrics
   - Business metrics

2. **Logging**
   - Centralized logging with ELK Stack
   - Structured logs for easier analysis

3. **Alerting**
   - Threshold-based alerts
   - Anomaly detection
   - On-call rotation

## Future Considerations

1. **Event-Driven Architecture**
   - Implement event sourcing for certain services
   - Use message queues for asynchronous processing

2. **GraphQL API**
   - Consider GraphQL for more flexible client-server interactions

3. **Machine Learning Integration**
   - Recommendation systems
   - Predictive analytics
   - Anomaly detection
