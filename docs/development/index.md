# Development Guide

This guide provides comprehensive information for developers working on the Halooid platform. Whether you're a new developer joining the project or an experienced contributor, this guide will help you understand the development process, tools, and best practices.

## Development Philosophy

The Halooid platform follows these core development principles:

1. **Code Quality**: We prioritize clean, maintainable code over quick solutions.
2. **Reusability**: We identify opportunities for shared components and libraries.
3. **Simplicity**: We keep implementations as simple as possible for solo development.
4. **Documentation**: We ensure thorough documentation for future reference.
5. **Testing**: We include appropriate tests for critical functionality.

## Development Environment

### Prerequisites

Before you begin development, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Go** (version 1.20 or later)
- **Node.js** (version 18 or later)
- **Flutter** (version 3.0 or later)
- **Docker** and **Docker Compose**
- **PostgreSQL** (version 14 or later)
- **Redis** (version 6 or later)
- **Git**

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

We provide a setup script that will check for required tools and help set up your development environment.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Jerinji2016/halooid.git
   cd halooid
   ```

2. Run the setup script:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/setup-dev-env.sh
   ```

3. Start the development environment:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. Install backend dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   go mod download
   ```

5. Install frontend dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd ../web
   npm install
   ```

6. Install mobile dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd ../mobile
   flutter pub get
   ```

For more detailed instructions, see the [Setup Guide](../getting-started/setup.md).

## Project Structure

The Halooid platform follows a monorepo approach with the following structure:

```text

├── backend/                # Backend services
│   ├── cmd/                # Application entry points
│   ├── internal/           # Private application code
│   ├── pkg/                # Reusable packages
│   ├── api/                # API definitions

└── docs/                   # Documentation
```

## Development Workflow

### Feature Development Process

1. **Planning**: Define the feature requirements and design.
2. **Implementation**: Develop the feature according to the design.
3. **Testing**: Write and run tests to ensure the feature works as expected.
4. **Documentation**: Update documentation to reflect the new feature.
5. **Review**: Submit a pull request for review.
6. **Deployment**: Deploy the feature to production.

### Branch Strategy

We follow a feature branch workflow:

1. Create a new branch for each feature or bug fix:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/feature-name
   ```

2. Make your changes and commit them:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add feature X"
   ```

3. Push your branch to the remote repository:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/feature-name
   ```

4. Create a pull request for review.

### Code Review Process

All code changes must go through a code review process before being merged into the main branch. The code review process ensures that:

1. The code meets our quality standards.
2. The code follows our coding conventions.
3. The code is well-tested.
4. The code is well-documented.

For more information about the development workflow, see the [Workflow Guide](workflow.md).

## Coding Standards

### Go

- Follow the [Go Code Review Comments](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments).
- Use [gofmt](https://golang.org/cmd/gofmt/) to format your code.
- Follow the [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go) guidelines.

### Svelte

- Follow the [Svelte Style Guide](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#style-guide).
- Use ESLint and Prettier for code formatting.

### Flutter

- Follow the [Flutter Style Guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/style-guide).
- Use the Flutter formatter (`flutter format`).

For more information about coding standards, see the [Coding Standards Guide](coding-standards.md).

## Testing

### Backend Testing

- Write unit tests for all business logic.
- Write integration tests for API endpoints.
- Use Go's built-in testing framework.

### Frontend Testing

- Write unit tests for components and stores.
- Use Jest and Testing Library for testing.

### Mobile Testing

- Write unit tests for widgets and services.
- Use Flutter's built-in testing framework.

For more information about testing, see the [Testing Guide](testing.md).

## Documentation

### Code Documentation

- Document all public APIs.
- Use comments to explain complex logic.
- Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes.

### User Documentation

- Write clear and concise user guides.
- Include screenshots and examples.
- Update documentation when features change.

### API Documentation

- Document all API endpoints.
- Include request and response examples.
- Specify error codes and messages.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Database Connection Issues**: Check that PostgreSQL is running and the connection string is correct.
- **Redis Connection Issues**: Check that Redis is running and the connection string is correct.
- **Build Errors**: Check that all dependencies are installed and up-to-date.
